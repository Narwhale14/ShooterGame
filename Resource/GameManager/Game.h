 * @brief The game class declaration file. The Game class is the core class that brings everything together. Constantly updates through checking the current top active GameState
 *        and checking for SFML events. Contains variable deltaTime, which will make frame time consistent across devices by setting it to the time in-between frames and
 *        multiplying it with anything that requires movement or constant updating
